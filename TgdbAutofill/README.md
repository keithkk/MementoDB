# TgdbDs
Autofill script for The Games DB (http://thegamesdb.net)

Uses code from:

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isaacs/sax-js/master/lib/sax.js
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nfarina/xmldoc/master/lib/xmldoc.js

To use this in your own database, you must include TgdbDs.js and the built-in
moment.min.js libraries.  Call it with:

>`TgdbDs(query);`
