# TgdbDs
Autofill script for The Games DB (http://thegamesdb.net)

Uses code from:

* https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js
* https://github.com/nfarina/xmldoc

To use this in your own database, you must include TgdbAutofill.js and the
built-in moment.min.js libraries.  Call it with:

>`TgdbAutofill(query);`
